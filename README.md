# GradeTester
GradeTester is a tool which helps you to check the average of your school grades.
Select the subject, the number of grades you're going to consider and put your
grades. The program will give you the average of your grades and it will let you
insert the goal you wanna reach. Then it will tell you which grades you have to
take to reach the chosen goal or the grades you shouldn't take to go under your
goal.

### How it works
Just download the **ZIP** file, extract it and run the executable file you find in it.
